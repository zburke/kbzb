Kbzb (pronounced 'kib-zib') is a Perl port of [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com), a kick-ass web application framework for PHP. CodeIgniter's goal "is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries."

Why write yet another web framework when so many already exist ([Maypole](http://maypole.perl.org/), [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/), [Jifty](http://www.jifty.org). [CGI::Prototype](http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Prototype/lib/CGI/Prototype.pm), [CGI::Application](http://search.cpan.org/~markstos/CGI-Application-3.21/lib/CGI/Application.pm), [Gantry](http://search.cpan.org/~tkeefer/Gantry-3.54/lib/Gantry.pm)...)? I've worked in many shops with apps written in both Perl and PHP, and maintenance is a headache because everything is done so differently. This addresses that. And as much as I'm a big fan of CodeIgniter, I'm not a big fan of PHP. This addresses that, too.

This is a work in progress. Many of the modules are well documented, but some still need help. Some of the modules have tests written for them, but most do not. Some libraries and helpers still need to be written. Please bear with me, or better yet, please help!
